My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

### How to Run

- Visit the above website and navigate to a particular puzzle's webpage for a full problem description
- Run the `python` program that corresponds to the problem you're viewing
- Enjoy!

Note: _I participated in these fun challenges to get better at Python, promote daily coding, and have fun. While I wasn't able to solve every puzzle, I tried my best each day, and I hope you enjoy looking at and running this code! I aim to come back again later and finish the puzzles I couldn't solve earlier!_
