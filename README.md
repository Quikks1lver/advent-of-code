My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

### How to Run

- Visit the above website and navigate to a particular puzzle's webpage for a full problem description.
- I think we're not supposed to submit our own input files, so please use your own input files in the `Input\` subdir for each year.
- Run the `python` program that corresponds to the problem you're viewing. In other years, if I use a different language, follow that year's README.
- Enjoy!

Note: _I greatly enjoy these annual coding puzzles, as they help me become a better programmer and are super fun to solve during the holiday season. Thanks Eric / AoC team!_
