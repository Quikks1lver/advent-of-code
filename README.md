My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) puzzles.

### How to Run
- Visit the above website and navigate to a problem to view the full description (I include a short-version of the challenge problem at the bottom of each ``.py`` file)
- Run the ``python`` program that corresponds to the problem you're viewing
- Enjoy!

Note: _I participated in these fun challenges to get better at Python and promote daily coding. While I wasn't able to solve **every** puzzle, I tried my best each day, and I hope you enjoy looking at and running this code! I aim to come back again later and finish the puzzles I couldn't solve earlier!_
