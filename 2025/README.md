# Mypy Setup for 2025

I wanted to learn to use `mypy` this year. It's a module for static type checking.
Here's how to use it.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install `mypy`.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mypy
```

3. Run the wrapper, example for `day01.py`.

```bash
./run2025.sh 2025/day01.py
```
